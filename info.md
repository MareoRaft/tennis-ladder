MOBILE-first css.

sticky header for table
table (list) alternates btw white and offwhite
bg is offwhite
there is a right sidebar w functions:
  * join
  * report score
  * contact
  * github
  * buy me a coffee
  * show/hide details (for more/less fields shown in table)

table columns:
  * name
  * age
  * approx rating (e.g. 4.0)
  * adjusted rating (using a least squares minimization)
  * points
  * ranking
  * free time - preferred time to play
  * contact (users can put a phone no or email, etc)

use alert system just like Payout for user interactions.

sticky footer tennis tips banner?  always wear a helmet.  drink a few sips of water every changeover.  wear a hat.  approach down the line.  grip it and rip it!

score reporting: 5 sets in the usual spatial arrangement.  Each value is an input box with "0" placeholder.  Validation when they click 'ok'.

tennis theme, w yellow buttons?  yay

sound of a tennis racket whacking a ball whenever they click.  like the sound in the US Open commercials.
